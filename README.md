# CNIT425Project
An application that connects devices through Bluetooth and then plays a game similar to HQX. Users will be asked to answer a prompt by taking a photo and editing it with simple editing tools to best fit the prompt at hand. The users will then be able to vote for the other players pictures with the winner gaining points. At the end of the game the winner will be displayed.
